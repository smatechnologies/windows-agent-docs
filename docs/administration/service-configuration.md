# Service configuration

There are two configuration options for the Windows Agent service logon:

1. Run the Service as the Local System Account.
2. Run the Service as a Windows Domain User.

Selection of the logon type affects the security, network access, and performance of the Windows Agent.

SMA Technologies recommends running the agent as Local System because it is the only way for the agent to have all of the system level privileges needed. Access for UNC paths and shared drives must be managed through the user account running the job and through startup scripts defined in the MSLSAM.ini file. In this mode, be sure to select a Windows User account from your network for the Windows User Id in the Job Definitions in the Enterprise Manager.

For information on configuring mapped network drives in the MSLSAM.ini file, refer to [Using the InitializationScript and TerminationScript](scripts). For information on entering a Windows User, refer to [Adding a Batch User for Windows](https://help.smatechnologies.com/opcon/core/Files/UI/Enterprise-Manager/Adding-Batch-Users/#setting-up-a-new-microsoft-ms-lsam-batch-user) in the **Enterprise Manager** online help.

:::tip
SMA Technologies strongly recommends running as Local System Account.

## Configure the Windows Agent to run as a Local System Account

1. Use menu path: **Start \> Control Panel**.
2. Double-click the **Administrative Tools** icon.
3. Double-click the **Services** icon to run the Service Control Manager.

## Run the Windows Agent as a Windows Domain User

The domain user must have the following:

- Membership in the local Administrators group
- The following advanced Windows privileges:
  - Act as part of the operating system
  - Adjust memory quotas for a process
  - Log on as a service
  - Log on as a batch job
  - Replace a process-level token

:::caution
This user must have logged on to this machine before trying to start the service. The initial login creates a Windows user profile required by the Windows Agent running as a Domain User.

Please refer to the Domain Administrator about acquiring the appropriate privileges.
