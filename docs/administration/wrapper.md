# Using the StartAllProcessWrapper

StartAllProcessWrapper scripts are typically used if you want to run through a certain fixed set of activities for every job started by the LSAM. Typically, they are used for capturing Job Start/stop times, environment variables, stdout, and stderr values for the job, etc. All these values are now available by default in the JobLogs available through "View Job Output".
