# Determine installation media

In the documentation for running the setup program, replace **<media\>** with the desired method of delivery:

- **USB**: If using a USB drive, plug the USB drive into a machine and copy the installation files to a folder on the hard drive of the machine where the software will be installed. Run the installation from the hard drive.
- **FTP**: If downloading the files over FTP, the best practice is to download the installation files directly to a folder on the hard drive of the machine where the software will be installed. Run the installation from the hard drive.
- **DVD-ROM**: Insert the DVD into the drive and execute the installation from the DVD. The files may also be copied to the hard drive.
- **ISO**: Mount the ISO image as a virtual DVD and execute the installation from that location.
