# Windows LSAM release notes

## Windows Agent 20.2.0

:white_check_mark: **WIN-608**: Fixed an issue in the Windows agent where a Windows update (KB5001879) on Windows Server 2019 caused the agent to not start up correctly.

:white_check_mark: **WIN-607**: Fixed an issue in the Windows Agent where a post process would not accept any arguments passed to it. Now, if the post process defined in the config has arguments, you may specify them after enclosing the full post process path in double quotes, followed by the list of arguments.

## Windows Agent 20.1.0

2021 April

:eight_spoked_asterisk: **WIN-597**: Exit codes for Chronoman are updated (given in OpCon 20.0.0 documentation) to match the ones available on the Linux platform, since Chronoman is now also available in the OpCon Docker image, that runs as a Linux job. For older error codes, see [Chronoman documentation](https://help.smatechnologies.com/opcon/core/v19.1/index.htm#Files/Utilities/Command-line%20Utilities/Chronoman.htm#Chronoman_Command_Line_and_Command_File_Errors).

:white_check_mark: **WIN-602**: Fixed an issue in Windows Agent where it failed to purge job output directory.

:white_check_mark: **WIN-601**: Fixed an issue with file transfer where a UNIX to Windows transfer in ASCII mode, using compression sometimes resulted in UNIX line endings in part of the file, instead of all Windows line endings.

:white_check_mark: **WIN-593**: Fixed an issue in file transfer from length-based-record platforms (e.g. IBMi, MCP, etc.) to Windows where the record separator was inserted in the wrong location resulting in Index Out of Bound exception.

:white_check_mark: **WIN-581**: Fixed an issue in Windows Agent where after a system reboot, the agent did not start up if the TCP/IP stack was not initialized. Now agent has retry logic to attempt listening on the socket few times before erroring or starting up.

:white_check_mark: **WIN-566**: Updated SMADirectory to reference a .Net library locally rather than depend on the one installed on the target system, which may cause issues if it is not found or has a different version.

:white_check_mark: **WIN-564**: Fixed an issue in Windows Agent where encrypted global properties in embedded scripts did not get decrypted correctly.

## Windows Agent 20.0.0

## Windows Agent 19.0.0

2019 July

:white_check_mark: Fixed a timer issue in SMA Resource Monitor where if MaxConcurrentFiles was set to process one file at a time, this was ignored and two files attempted to process at once, which caused a failure.

:white_check_mark: Fixed an issue where File Arrival would not work with negative Start Time and End Time offsets for decimal separators other than a period (.).

:white_check_mark: Fixed an issue with the Windows LSAM recovery code where the LSAM crashed when a job finished but its status had not been reported back to SMANetCom and the job was in the tracking file with an empty Exit status description.

## Windows Agent 18.3.2

2019 May

## Windows Agent 18.3.0

2018 November

:white_check_mark: Fixed an issue with SMA File Transfer where including at least four periods (.) in a folder name caused it to be considered an IP address.
