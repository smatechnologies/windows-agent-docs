# Job Output Retrieval System

MSJORS.exe is a Windows service used to retrieve the output (stdout/stderr along with some additional information) generated by each job running through the LSAM. This output is helpful in identifying any runtime errors that might have occurred while the jobs are running.

CaptureJobOutput MUST be set to TRUE for "View Job Output" feature to work.

MSJORS service communicates on a specific port number configured in MSLSAM.ini JORSSocket setting under JORS Settings section. This value must match the JORS Port Number configured in Advanced Machines Configuration - Communication Settings.

When CaptureJobOutput is set to TRUE, JORS captures the following information for each job:

- Internal Job Name
- Job Command Line
- Job Arguments
- Environment variable list
- STDOUT generated
- STDERR generated
- Job Start/End Time
- Job Process Name and PID
- Job ExitCode

The LSAM creates one log file for each job with all the above information pertinent to that job. The job log file is created under the JobOutput folder when job is running and eventually saved under the <Output Directory\>\\MSLSAM\\JobOutput\\Archives\\<Job schedule Date\> folder when job completes.

:::note
The Output Directory was configured during the installation. For more information, refer to [File Locations](https://help.smatechnologies.com/opcon/core/latest/Files/Concepts/File%20Locations.htm) in the **Concepts** online help.

The archived JobOutput folders also get cleaned up based on ArchiveDaysToKeep setting configured under Debug Options. Any output logs older than ArchiveDaysToKeep get cleaned up at midnight.
